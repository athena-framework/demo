# `src/resolvers`

The `src/resolvers` directory contains all of the custom [ATH::Controller::ValueResolvers](https://athenaframework.org/Framework/Controller/ValueResolvers/Interface/) created for the application. For example, one was created to provide an `Blog::Entities::Article` instance to the controller from the database, based on the `id` route path parameter.
